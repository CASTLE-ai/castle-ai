CASTLE integrates the strengths of visual foundation models trained on large datasets possess open-world visual concepts, including Segment Anything (SA), DeAOT, and DINOv2, for one-shot image segmentation and unsupervised visual feature extraction. Furthermore, CASTLE employs unsupervised multi-stage and/or multi-layer UMAP clustering algorithms to distinguish behavioral clusters with unique temporal variability.
